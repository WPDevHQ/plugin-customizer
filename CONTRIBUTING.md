# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to plugin-customizer](https://github.com/soderlind/plugin-customizer/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

My plugins are following the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards).

Thanks,
Per SÃ¸derlind
